This Whitewater River Pack is a collection of assets to create a realistic river environment.

Load the Whitewater_River.unity for an example scene, or drag your required river Prefab (River_Small.prefab, River_Medium.prefab or River_Large.prefab) from the Project window into the Hierarchy window. Note that these assets are tileable, so you can repeat the asset to create a river to your required size.

Additional assets are in the Prefab folder to dress your scene further, including grass, plants, trees and rocks.

Have fun!
