Update 1.4 adds Colorblindness test LUTs.

Use them to easily check for issues with your interface or important parts of your project, or just to view how Colorblind people would see it. 
Simply input the LUTs as usual and behold the result, adjust accordingly. 

Example: A traffic light that looks "Red, Yellow, Green" for us, can look all Yellow for people with Deuteranopia, removing its warning / signalizing effect.
This can also occur in your interface, and the LUTs can help spotting such issues. 

Default and Amplify Color / Scion versions are included in this folder for the 3 most common occurances.
